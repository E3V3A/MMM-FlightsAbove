This is a modified version of radar(), built updon v0.2.1 and is not used in MMM-FLightsAbove. 
It is provided as an inforamtive back or future-compatible option.

If you want to use this, then you still need to have the requires.
Most simply by first installing the v0.3.0 "flightradar24-client" with npm.
Then just point your requires to this:  `./lib/radar`
